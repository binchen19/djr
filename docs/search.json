    "text": "About this book\nThis book is a collection of my notes from the Data Journalism courses I have been teaching at The University of Hong Kong. The course is centered around using R for data analysis, equipping students with the skills to collect, clean, analyze, and visualize data in a journalistic context.\nWhile originally designed as a companion for my students, I hope this book will also benefit a wider audience—including journalists, aspiring data storytellers, and students interested in learning R for data analysis. Through practical examples and real-world case studies, this book provides a hands-on approach to integrating data into storytelling.\nHope you find it useful! 🤗",

R Markdown files use a combination of Markdown and R code to create dynamic documents. You can include text, code chunks, and output in your R Markdown file.\n\nMetadata\nOn top right of the R Markdown file, you will see a YAML front matter section, which is used to define metadata for the document. This metadata is enclosed within triple-dashed lines.\nYou can specify metadata such as the title, author, date, and output format in the YAML front matter section. Here is an example of metadata in a R Markdown file:\n---\ntitle: \"Data Journalism\"\nsubtitle: \"Week 1\"\nauthor: \"Bin Chen\"\ndate: \"Jan 20, 2025\"\nformat: html\n---\n\n\nText Content\nYou can write narrative text in your R Markdown file using Markdown syntax. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text using simple and intuitive syntax. You can use Markdown to create headings, lists, links, images, and more.\nHere is an example of Markdown text in a R Markdown file: - Heading: # Heading 1 - Bold: **bold text** - List: - item 1 - Link: [link text](https://www.example.com) - Image: ![](path/to/image.png) - Code: `code`\n\n\nCode Chunks\nYou can include R code in your R Markdown file using code chunks. Code chunks are enclosed within three backticks and curly braces, indicating the language of the code (in this case, R).\nYou can insert a code chunk by clicking the green “+” icon in the top right corner of the R Markdown file and selecting “R”, or you can user the keyboard shortcut “Ctrl + Alt + I” on Windows or “Cmd + Option + I” on Mac.\nHere is an example of a code chunk in a R Markdown file:\n\n1 + 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRMarkdown Cheatsheet Preview\n\n\n\n\nDownload full RMarkdown cheatsheets\n\n\nRender the R Markdown file\nOnce you have written your R Markdown file, you can render it to create a dynamic document. To render the R Markdown file, click the “knit” button in the top right corner of the R Markdown file. This will run the R code chunks and generate the output in the specified format.",

Read the error message carefully to understand the problem.\nCheck the code: Review the code that caused the error. Look for syntax errors, missing parentheses, brackets, or quotation marks, and other common mistakes.\nUse the help panel: RStudio has a help panel that provides information about functions, packages, and error messages. Use the help panel to look up information related to the error.\nSearch online: If you are unable to resolve the error, search online for solutions. Websites like Stack Overflow, RStudio Community, and the R documentation can be helpful resources.\nPosting your questions: If you are still unable to resolve the error, ask for help.

    "text": "2.6 Coding habits\n\nComment your code: Add comments to your code to explain what it does. Comments make your code easier to understand and maintain.\nUse meaningful variable names: Choose variable names that are descriptive and meaningful. Avoid using single-letter variable names like x or y. Also, please avoid using reserved words in R, such as mean, sum, data, etc, and do NOT use space, dash, or other special characters in variable names. It is always recommended to use underscore _ to separate words in variable names. Again, use all lowercase letters in variable names to make your life easier.\nOrganize your code: Organize your code into sections using comments or markdown headers. This makes it easier to navigate and understand your code.\n\n\nTips for learning R coding\n\n“Copy, Paste, and Tweak”: When writing code, it’s common to copy and paste existing code and then tweak it to fit your needs. This can save time and reduce errors.\n“Save, Save, Save”: Save your work frequently to avoid losing your progress.\nPractice, practice, practice: The more you practice writing R code, the more comfortable and proficient you will become.\nCall ? for help: If you are unsure about how to use a function or need more information, you can call ?function_name to access the help file for that function.\n\nSome extra notes on using the ? operator: In R or RStudio, you can always use the ? operator to call for help on a function or dataset, but the specific syntax may differ - depends on whether the package containing that function or dataset is loaded. Here’s how it works:\n\nFor Loaded Packages: If the package is already loaded using library() or require(), you can directly use the ? operator with the name of the function or dataset. For example, if you have already loaded the ggplot2 package (included in tidyverse), you can simply write ?ggplot to get help on the ggplot function.\nFor Unloaded Packages: If the package is not loaded, RStudio does not automatically know where to look for documentation unless you specify the package name. In this case, you have two options:\n\nLoad the Package: You can first load the package using library(packagename) and then use the ? operator as usual.\nDirect Specification: You can directly specify the package when using the ? operator, even if it’s not loaded. You do this by using ?packagename::functionname. For example, to get help on the ggplot function in ggplot2 without loading the package, you would write ?ggplot2::ggplot.",

Imported with readxl or openxlsx.\nSPSS, SAS, Stata Files: Common in social science and survey research. Use specialized R packages to import.\nRDS Files: Binary format for storing R objects, preserving their structure and class information.\nRData Files: Binary format for saving multiple R objects in a single file, often used for workspaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor this course, we will focus on CSV files, as they are simple and widely used.\n\n\n\nCSV Files with readr (tidyverse) package\nFirst, we download the CSV file from the web and save it locally as hksalary.csv.

This is not a standard date format, therefore, we may not be able to use as.Date() to convert it to a date object. Instead, we can extract the year as an integer and store it in a new column.\nWe can use mutate() to create a new column year that contains the year as an integer.\nmutate() is a function from the dplyr package that is used to create new columns or modify existing columns in a data frame. It takes the data frame as the first argument and then specifies the new column name and its value using the assignment operator =.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen you do data cleaning, tt is always recommended to create a new column rather than modifying the original column. This way, you can keep the original data intact and have a record of the changes you made. Also, you should create a new dataframe rather than modifying the original dataframe.\n\n\nHere is how we do the data cleaning: - name the new dataframe as df1 - create a new column year that contains the first four characters of the Academic Year column by using the substr() function\n\ndf1 &lt;- df |&gt;\n  mutate(year = substr(`Academic Year`, 1, 4))\n\nglimpse(df1)\n\nRows: 368\nColumns: 5\n$ `Academic Year`                     &lt;chr&gt; \"2009/10\", \"2009/10\", \"2009/10\", \"…\n$ `Level of Study`                    &lt;chr&gt; \"Sub-degree\", \"Sub-degree\", \"Sub-d…\n$ `Broad Academic Programme Category` &lt;chr&gt; \"Medicine, Dentistry and Health\", …\n$ `Average Annual Salary (HK$'000)`   &lt;dbl&gt; 292, 125, 125, 139, 163, 122, 155,…\n$ year                                &lt;chr&gt; \"2009\", \"2009\", \"2009\", \"2009\", \"2…\n\n\nQuestion here: can we attach the head()function to the mutate() functions above? why and why not?\n\n\nChange column name\n\nrename()\nTo change column names, another function often used is rename(). It is a function from the dplyr package that is used to rename columns in a data frame. It takes the data frame as the first argument and then specifies the new column names using the assignment operator =.\nfor example, you can rename the columns in the df data frame as follows:\n\ndf2 &lt;- df1 |&gt;\n  rename(`level` = `Level of Study`,\n         `category` = `Broad Academic Programme Category`,\n         `salary` = `Average Annual Salary (HK$'000)`)\n\nglimpse(df2)\n\nRows: 368\nColumns: 5\n$ `Academic Year` &lt;chr&gt; \"2009/10\", \"2009/10\", \"2009/10\", \"2009/10\", \"2009/10\",…\n$ level           &lt;chr&gt; \"Sub-degree\", \"Sub-degree\", \"Sub-degree\", \"Sub-degree\"…\n$ category        &lt;chr&gt; \"Medicine, Dentistry and Health\", \"Sciences\", \"Enginee…\n$ salary          &lt;dbl&gt; 292, 125, 125, 139, 163, 122, 155, 346, 148, 154, 157,…\n$ year            &lt;chr&gt; \"2009\", \"2009\", \"2009\", \"2009\", \"2009\", \"2009\", \"2009\"…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can also use the mutate() function to rename columns by creating new columns with the new names.\nThe differences between mutate() and rename() are: mutate() is used to create new columns or modify existing columns, while rename() is used to rename existing columns. So you see after using mutate(), you get 4 more new columns.\nWhen you use rename() to rename columns, and if the column names contain spaces or special characters, you need to enclose the column names in backticks (`) or double quotes (“).\n\n\n\n\n\nChange data type\n\nas.integer(): convert a character or numeric column to an integer column.\nas.numeric(): convert a character or integer column to a numeric column.\nas.character(): convert a numeric or integer column to a character column.\nas.Date(): convert a character column to a date column.\n\nWe found that the year column is stored as an character type, but we want to store it as an integer type. We can use the as.integer() function to convert the year column to an integer.\n\ndf3 &lt;- df2 |&gt;\n  mutate(year = as.integer(year))\n\ndf3 |&gt; head()\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nselect()\nWe found now we have 8 columns but we only want to keep the year, level, category, and salary columns. We can use the select() function to keep only the columns we want.\nselect() is a function from the dplyr package that is used to select columns in a data frame. It takes the data frame as the first argument and then specifies the columns to keep using the column names.\n\ndf4 &lt;- df3 |&gt;\n  select(year, level, category, salary)\n\nhead(df3)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nString functions with pipe operator |&gt;\nFrom this week, we will start to use the |&gt; operator to string functions together. This operator is available in R version 4.1.0 and later. It allows you to pass the result of one function to the next function as the first argument. This can make your code more concise and easier to read, especially when you have multiple data manipulation steps.\nA simple use of “|&gt;” operate is to write the object first and then followed by the function. For example, df |&gt; head() is equivalent to head(df).\nNow, we can combine all the data cleaning steps together using the pipe operator |&gt;.\n\ndf_clean &lt;- df |&gt;\n  rename(`year` = `Academic Year`,\n         `level` = `Level of Study`,\n         `category` = `Broad Academic Programme Category`,\n         `salary` = `Average Annual Salary (HK$'000)`) |&gt;\n  mutate(year = substr(year, 1, 4)) |&gt;\n  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) |&gt;\n  select(year, level, category, salary)\n\nstr(df_clean)\n\ntibble [368 × 4] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ year    : int [1:368] 2009 2009 2009 2009 2009 2009 2009 2009 2009 2009 ...\n $ level   : chr [1:368] \"Sub-degree\" \"Sub-degree\" \"Sub-degree\" \"Sub-degree\" ...\n $ category: chr [1:368] \"Medicine, Dentistry and Health\" \"Sciences\" \"Engineering and Technology\" \"Business and Management\" ...\n $ salary  : num [1:368] 292 125 125 139 163 122 155 346 148 154 ...",

Because we can not do math operations on a character string, and also it may sort the year in a wrong order if we sort it as a character string.\nNormally, we can use some functions to convert a character string to a date. For example: we first created a character string today_char and then converted it to a date object today_date using the as.Date() function.\n\ntoday_char &lt;- \"2025/02/17\"\nstr(today_char)\n\n chr \"2025/02/17\"\n\n\n\ntoday_date &lt;- as.Date(today_char, format = \"%Y/%m/%d\")\nstr(today_date)\n\n Date[1:1], format: \"2025-02-17\"\n\n\nas.Date() function is a baseR function used to convert a character string to a date object.

We use + to combine multiple layers in the plot.\n\n\nWe can add more customization to the plot, such as changing the color of the bars, adding labels, and adjusting the theme.\n\nMore Customizations:\nWe can add more customization to the plot, such as changing the color of the bars, adding labels, and adjusting the theme.\n\ndf_clean |&gt;\n  filter(year == 2022) |&gt;\n  group_by(level) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_salary = mean(salary)) |&gt;\n1  ggplot(aes(x = level, y = avg_salary, fill = level)) +\n2  geom_col(width = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Annual Salary by Level of Study\",\n       subtitle = str_wrap(\"In the academic year 2022-2023, Taught Postgraduate graduates have the highest average annual salary.\"),\n       x = \"Level of Study\",\n       y = \"Average Annual Salary (HK$'000)\",\n3       caption = \"Source: DATA.GOV.HK | Author: Bin Chen\") +\n4  theme_minimal() +\n5  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n1\n\nUse fill = level in aes() to color the bars by the level column.\n\n2\n\nUse geom_col(width = 0.7) to adjust the width of the bars to make them thinner.\n\n3\n\nUse labs() to add a subtitle and caption to the plot.\n\n4\n\nUse theme_minimal() to apply a minimal theme to the plot.\n\n5\n\nUse theme(legend.position = \"none\") to remove the legend from the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can explore more themes and customize the plot further using the theme() function. Common themes include theme_bw(), theme_classic(), theme_minimal().\n\n\n\n\nAdding values to the bars\nAdding values to the bars can help readers better understand the data. We can use the geom_text() function to add text labels to the bars. However, the values of average salary are too long to be displayed on the bars. We can just show the rounded values by using the round() function.\n\ndf_clean |&gt;\n  filter(year == 2022) |&gt;\n  group_by(level) |&gt;\n1  summarise(avg_salary = round(mean(salary), 2)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = level, y = avg_salary, fill = level)) + \n  geom_col(width = 0.7) + \n2  geom_text(aes(label = avg_salary), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Annual Salary by Level of Study\",\n       x = \"Level of Study\",\n       y = \"Average Annual Salary (HK$'000)\") +\n  theme_light() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n1\n\nUse round(mean(salary), 2) to round the average salary to two decimal places.\n\n2\n\nUse geom_text() to add text labels to the bars. The vjust = -0.5 argument adjusts the vertical position of the labels, and the size = 3 argument adjusts the font size of the labels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColor Palette\nYou may find the default color palette not visually appealing. You can customize the color palette using the scale_fill_manual() function to specify the colors for the four bars.\n\n## specify four colors\ncolors &lt;- c(\"#FF6F61\", \"#6B5B95\", \"#88B04B\", \"#F7CAC9\")\n\ndf_clean |&gt;\n  filter(year == 2022) |&gt;\n  group_by(level) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_salary = mean(salary)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = level, y = avg_salary, fill = level)) +\n  geom_col(width = 0.7) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Annual Salary by Level of Study\",\n       x = \"Level of Study\",\n       y = \"Average Annual Salary (HK$'000)\") +\n1  scale_fill_manual(values = colors) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n1\n\nUse scale_fill_manual() to specify the colors for the bars using the values argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can use some tools to find good color palettes, such as ColorBrewer, Paletton, and Coolors.",

You can specify the palette name to use different color schemes. It is automatically loaded when you load the ggplot2 package. A complete list of available palettes can be found in the RColorBrewer package documentation.\n\n\n\n\nSpecify aes() in multi-layer plots\nIn the previous examples, we specify the aes() function only in the main ggplot() function. However, you can also specify the aes() function in each geom_ function to customize the aesthetics for each layer.\nFor example, for the line plot, if we want to customize shape of points for each level, we can specify the shape aesthetics in the geom_point() functions.\n\ndf_clean |&gt;\n  group_by(year, level) |&gt; \n  summarise(avg_salary = mean(salary)) |&gt; \n1  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_salary, color = level)) +\n  geom_line() + \n2  geom_point(aes(shape = level)) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Set1\") + \n  labs(title = \"Average Annual Salary of Graduates by Level of Study Over the Years\", \n       x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Average Annual Salary (HK$'000)\", \n       color = \"Level of Study\") + \n  theme_bw() \n\n\n1\n\nWhen you specify aes(color = level) in the main ggplot(), it applies the color aesthetic globally to both the geom_line() and geom_point() layers (or any subsequent geoms). This means that both the lines and the points will be colored by the level variable unless you override it in the individual geoms.\n\n2\n\nWhen you specify aes(shape = level) in geom_point(), it controls the shape of the points based on the level variable, but only for the points. The lines won’t be affected by the shape aesthetic because geom_line() doesn’t use shapes.\n\n\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, you will see we created a separate legend, this is because we specified the shape aesthetics in the geom_point() function.

We can use the fct_reorder() function from the forcats package to reorder the bars by the number of wildfires.\n\ndf_clean |&gt;\n  count(location) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(location, n), y = n)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Number of Wildfires by County\",\n       x = \"County\",\n       y = \"Number of Wildfires\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can add text labels to the bars using the geom_text() function, with the vjust and hjust arguments to adjust the position of the labels.\n\ndf_clean |&gt;\n  count(location) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(location, n), y = n)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Number of Wildfires by County\",\n       x = \"County\",\n       y = \"Number of Wildfires\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  geom_text(aes(label = n), vjust = 0, hjust = 1.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s put all the code together:\n\ndf_clean |&gt;\n1  count(location) |&gt;\n2  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(location, n), y = n)) +\n3  geom_col(fill = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Number of Wildfires by County\",\n       x = \"County\",\n4       y = \"Number of Wildfires\") +\n5  theme_bw() +\n6  coord_flip() +\n7  geom_text(aes(label = n), vjust = -0.5, hjust = 1.1)\n\n\n1\n\nCount the number of wildfires by county.\n\n2\n\nMap the county names to the x-axis and the number of wildfires to the y-axis.\n\n3\n\nCreate a bar chart with red bars.\n\n4\n\nAdd labels for the title, x-axis, and y-axis.\n\n5\n\nUse a black-and-white theme.\n\n6\n\nFlip the x and y axes to create a horizontal bar chart.\n\n7\n\nAdd text labels to the bars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine Plot: Number of Wildfires by Year for Each County\nWe chose to use a line plot to visualize the number of wildfires by year for each county because it is a good way to show trends over time.\nLet’s start by calculating the number of wildfires by year for each county using the group_by() and summarize() functions.\n\ndf_clean |&gt;\n  count(location, year = year(date))\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThen, we can create a line plot using ggplot(). Remember the key components of a line plot: - Data: The data frame with the variables to be plotted. - ggplot(aes(x, y)): The mapping between the data and the visual properties of the plot. - geom_line(): The geometric object for a line plot. - labs(): The labels for the title, x-axis, and y-axis.\nSince we want to show the number of wildfires by year for each county, we can map the year to the x-axis, the number of wildfires n to the y-axis, and the county names (location) to the color.\n\ndf_clean |&gt;\n  count(location, year = year(date)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, color = location)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Number of Wildfires by Year\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Number of Wildfires\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we see the plot, it is not very informative because there are too many counties. We can use the facet_wrap() function to create multiple plots based on the location variable, and remove the legend using theme(legend.position = \"none\"), also, we can change the theme to theme_bw().\n\ndf_clean |&gt;\n  count(location, year = year(date)) |&gt;\n1  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, color = location)) +\n2  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Number of Wildfires by County and Year\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n3       y = \"Number of wildfires\") +\n4  theme_bw() +\n5  facet_wrap(~location) +\n6  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n1\n\nMap the year to the x-axis, the number of wildfires to the y-axis, and the county names to the color.\n\n2\n\nCreate a line plot.\n\n3\n\nAdd labels for the title, x-axis, and y-axis.\n\n4\n\nUse a black-and-white theme.\n\n5\n\nCreate multiple plots based on the county names.\n\n6\n\nRemove the legend.",

Factor levels determine how categorical variables (like country) are displayed on the plot’s axes. 2. reorder(): In the aes() function of ggplot(), reorder(country, medallist_count) specifically reorders the factor levels of country based on the values of medallist_count. This ensures that when plotting, the countries with the highest medallist_count are shown in the order you want on the x-axis (or y-axis).\n\n\n\n\nScatter Plot\nWe will use a scatter plot to show the relationships between the number of medals and the age of the medallists.\n\ndf_clean |&gt;\n  mutate(age = 2024 - year(birth_date)) |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(age) == FALSE) |&gt;\n  group_by(age) |&gt;\n  summarise(medallist_count = n()) |&gt;\n1  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = medallist_count)) +\n2  geom_point() +\n3  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  labs(title = \"Relationship between Age and Number of Medallists\",\n       x = \"Age\",\n       y = \"Number of Medallists\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n1\n\nUse aes() to specify the x and y variables.\n\n2\n\nUse geom_point() to create a scatter plot.\n\n3\n\nUse geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") to add a linear regression line to the plot.\n\n\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld map\nUse a world map to show the distribution of medallists in Paris 2024.\nHere we will use two packages: rnaturalearth and rnaturalearthdata to get the world map data. The rnaturalearth package provides access to the Natural Earth dataset, which contains a variety of geospatial data, including country boundaries. The rnaturalearthdata package contains the data files needed to create maps using the rnaturalearth package.\n\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\nlibrary(rnaturalearthdata)\n\n\n1\n\nUse ne_countries() to get the world map data. The scale parameter specifies the level of detail for the map, and the returnclass parameter specifies the class of the returned object (in this case, a simple features object).\n\n\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'rnaturalearthdata'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:rnaturalearth':\n\n    countries110\n\n1world &lt;- ne_countries(scale = \"medium\", returnclass = \"sf\")\n\n\ndf_clean |&gt;\n  group_by(country_code) |&gt;\n  summarise(medallist_count = n()) |&gt;\n1  left_join(world, by = c(\"country_code\" = \"iso_a3\")) |&gt;\n2  ggplot() +\n3  geom_sf(aes(fill = medallist_count, geometry = geometry)) +\n4  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"B\", direction = -1, begin = 0.3, end = 0.8) +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Medallists in Paris 2024\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),  # Remove major grid lines\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),  # Remove minor grid lines\n    axis.text = element_blank(),         # Remove axis text\n    axis.title = element_blank(),        # Remove axis titles\n    axis.ticks = element_blank(),        # Remove axis ticks\n    panel.border = element_blank(),      # Remove panel border if desired\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", colour = NA),  # Set plot background color\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",          # Adjust legend position\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)  # Center the plot title\n  )\n\n\n1\n\nUse left_join() to join the world data with the df_clean data based on the country_code and iso_a3 columns. iso_a3 is the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code, such as “USA” for the United States.\n\n2\n\nUse ggplot() to create a plot.\n\n3\n\nUse geom_sf() to create a map. The fill aesthetic is set to medallist_count to color the map based on the number of medallists in each country. The geometry aesthetic specifies the geometry column in the world data, which means the map will be drawn based on the country boundaries.\n\n4\n\nUse scale_fill_viridis_c() to set the color scale for the map. The option parameter specifies the color palette, direction specifies the direction of the color gradient, and begin and end specify the color range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\ngeom_sf is a function in the ggplot2 package used to visualize simple features (spatial data) in R. It is specifically designed to handle geospatial objects, such as polygons, points, and lines that represent geographic data. The “sf” stands for simple features, a standard way to encode spatial vector data.",

You may need to do some data manipulation to get the result.\nLet’s define the “Unemployment” percentage as the number of “Unemployed” graduates divided by the total number of graduates for each university in the most recent surveyed year.\n\\[\n\\text{Unemployment Percentage} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Unemployed Graduates}}{\\text{Total Number of Graduates}}\n\\]\n::: {.callout-note title = “Question”} So take a minute to think about how you can get the result?

    "text": "16.5 More on data explore\nSo far, you have learnt how to explore a dataset by looking at the first few rows, the column details. Often, you may want to explore the dataset in more detail. Especially for columns/variables. You should notice that for different types of columns, you may need to use different strategies and functions to explore them. For example, for a numeric column, you may want to know the mean, median, min, max, etc. For a character column, you may want to know the unique values, the frequency of each unique value, etc.\n\nunique()\nFor example, in the df dataset, you may want to explore the Occupation column. You can use the unique() function to get all the unique values in the Occupation column.\nunique() is a function that returns a vector of the unique values in a vector or data frame column. It is provided by the base R, so you don’t need to load any additional packages to use it.\n\nunique(df$University)\n\n[1] \"City University of Hong Kong\"                      \n[2] \"Hong Kong Baptist University\"                      \n[3] \"Lingnan University\"                                \n[4] \"The Chinese University of Hong Kong\"               \n[5] \"The Education University of Hong Kong\"             \n[6] \"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University\"              \n[7] \"The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\"\n[8] \"The University of Hong Kong\"                       \n\n\n\n\ntable()\nYou may also want to know the frequency of each unique value in the Occupation column.

For example, if you want to know the frequency of each unique value in the Occupation column for each University, you can use the following code: table(df$University, df$Occupation).\n\n\n\nextension\nCan you use group_by and summarise to get the same result?\n\ndf |&gt;\n  group_by(Occupation) |&gt;\n  summarise(n = n())\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nsummary()\nNotice that the unique and table functions are particularly useful for character columns. For numeric columns, the exploration can be very straightforward, such as getting the mean, median, min, max, etc. For example, if you want to explore the percentage column in the df_percentage dataset.\n\nmean(df_percentage$percentage)\n\n[1] 1.69358\n\nmedian(df_percentage$percentage)\n\n[1] 1.435754\n\nmin(df_percentage$percentage)\n\n[1] 0.240096\n\nmax(df_percentage$percentage)\n\n[1] 4.75382\n\n\nAlso, there is a very handy function called summary() that can give you a summary of the numeric column. It provides the min, 1st Qu, median, mean, 3rd Qu, max for the numeric column.\n\nsummary(df_percentage$percentage)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n 0.2401  1.0485  1.4358  1.6936  2.2880  4.7538 \n\n\n\n1st Qu and 3rd Qu are the first and third quartiles, respectively. They are the values that divide the data into four equal parts. The median is the middle value of the data. The min and max are the minimum and maximum values of the data, respectively.\n\n\n\nhist()\nFor a numeric column, you may also want to know the distribution of the data. You can use the hist() function to plot a histogram of the data.\n\nhist(df_percentage$percentage)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note title = “Question”} Can you dont use hist() on a character column to get the distribution of the data, and why? :::\n\n\nskim package\nActually, there are some packages that can help you explore the data more efficiently. For example, the skimr package provides a more comprehensive summary of the data.\nFirst, lets load the skimr package.\n\n# install the package if you haven't installed it\n# run install.packages(\"skim\") in console, don't run this in the R markdown\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nThen, you can simply run the skim() function on the dataset to get a comprehensive summary of the data. Let’s try the skim() function on the df dataset.\n\nskim(df)\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\ndf\n\n\nNumber of rows\n5669\n\n\nNumber of columns\n6\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\ncharacter\n5\n\n\nnumeric\n1\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nempty\nn_unique\nwhitespace\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Year\n0\n1\n7\n7\n0\n14\n0\n\n\nUniversity\n0\n1\n18\n50\n0\n8\n0\n\n\nLevel of study\n0\n1\n10\n21\n0\n4\n0\n\n\nEmployment Situation\n0\n1\n6\n15\n0\n5\n0\n\n\nOccupation\n0\n1\n7\n70\n0\n31\n0\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Graduates (Headcount)\n0\n1\n51.34\n107.38\n1\n2\n11\n46\n1014\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will see the output including three pages: overall description, two one_skim_df. - The overall description provides the summary of the dataset, including the number of rows, columns, missing values, etc. - The second page page shows details for character columns. The useful information includes the number of missing values, the number of unique values. You may find this page also shows information about min and max, however, this is not about the min and max of the data, but the min and max of the length of the string in the column. - The third page shows a description of all the numeric columns. You will find in additional to n_missing, it also provides the mean, sd, p0, p25, p50, p75.",

It is useful when you have a lot of categories on the x-axis and the labels are long, so it is better to put them on the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreordering the bars\n\ndf_percentage |&gt;\n  filter(year_start == 2022) |&gt;\n1  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(university, percentage), y = percentage)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Unemployment Percentage by University in 2022/23\",\n       x = \" \",\n       y = \"Percentage (%)\")\n\n\n1\n\nfct_reorder() is a function that reorders the levels of a factor based on a summary statistic. In this case, we are reordering the levels of the university factor based on the percentage column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nfct_reorder() is a function provided by the forcats package, which is part of the tidyverse. You don’t need to load the forcats package explicitly because it is loaded automatically when you load the tidyverse.\n\n\n\n\nadd labels\n\ndf_percentage |&gt;\n  filter(year_start == 2022) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(university, percentage), y = percentage)) +\n  geom_col() +\n1  geom_text(aes(label = round(percentage, 1)), hjust = -0.1) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Unemployment Percentage by University in 2022/23\",\n       x = \"University\",\n       y = \"Percentage\")\n\n\n1\n\ngeom_text() is a function that adds text labels to the plot. In this case, we are adding the percentage values to the plot. The hjust argument controls the horizontal justification of the text. A value of -0.1 means the text is slightly to the right of the bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine Plot\n\nCreate a line plot to show the percentage of Unemployed graduates for HKU over the years.\n\n\ndf_percentage |&gt;\n  filter(university == \"The University of Hong Kong\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year_start, y = percentage)) +\n  geom_line() +\n1  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2009, 2022, 1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Unemployment Percentage of HKU Graduates Over the Years\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Percentage (%)\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n1\n\nscale_x_continuous() is a function that controls the breaks (tick marks) on the x-axis. In this case, we are setting the breaks to be every year from 2009 to 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine Plot with Multiple Lines\n\ndf_percentage |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year_start, y = percentage, color = university)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2009, 2022, 1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Unemployment Percentage of Graduates Over the Years\",\n       x = \" \",\n       y = \"Percentage (%)\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n1  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n1\n\ntheme(legend.position = \"bottom\") is a function that moves the legend to the bottom of the plot. The default position is at the right of the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWithin the theme() function, you can use the legend.position argument to control the position of the legend. The possible values are “none”, “left”, “right”, “top”, “bottom”, “topright”, “topleft”, “bottomright”, “bottomleft”.\n\n\n\n\nPlot with Facets\n\ndf_percentage |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year_start, y = percentage, color = university)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Unemployment Percentage of Graduates Over the Years\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Percentage (%)\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2009, 2022, 2)) +\n1  facet_wrap(~university) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n1\n\nfacet_wrap(~university) is a function that creates a separate plot for each level of the university factor. In this case, we are creating a separate plot for each university. The ~ symbol is used to specify the variable that you want to facet by.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the plots\n\ndf_percentage |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year_start, y = percentage, color = university)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Unemployment Percentage of Graduates Over the Years\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Percentage (%)\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2009, 2022, 2)) +\n  facet_wrap(~university) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n1\n\nggsave() is a function that saves the plot to a file. In this case, we are saving the plot as a PNG file with a width of 10 inches, a height of 6 inches, and a resolution of 300 dpi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1# ggsave(\"line_plot.png\", width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\ndpi stands for dots per inch, which is the resolution of the image. The higher the dpi, the higher the resolution of the image. The default dpi is 300, which is a good resolution for most purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\nArrange multiple plots\nSometimes, you may want to put multiple plots together for comparison or presentation. You can use the gridExtra package to arrange multiple plots on a single page. Install the gridExtra package if you haven’t installed it yet.\n\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\nHere you can created two plots p1 and p2 and put them together using the grid.arrange() function.\nThe code grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2) means to put p1 and p2 together in two columns.\n\np1 &lt;- df_percentage |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year_start, y = percentage, color = university)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Unemployment Percentage of Graduates Over the Years\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Percentage (%)\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2009, 2022, 2)) +\n  facet_wrap(~university) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\np2 &lt;- df_percentage |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year_start, y = percentage, color = university)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Unemployment Percentage of Graduates Over the Years\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Percentage (%)\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2009, 2022, 2)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n# put p1 and p2 together\ngrid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Plot with plotly\nWhen you plot using ggplot2, you can easily convert it to an interactive plot using the plotly package. This is super useful when you want to share your plot online or in a presentation, especially when the plot involves multiple lines or facets.\nInstall the plotly package if you haven’t installed it yet. (Run install.packages(\"plotly\") in the console)\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nFor example, here we first create a line plot using ggplot2, then convert it to an interactive plot using ggplotly().\n\np &lt;- df_percentage |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = year_start, y = percentage, color = university)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = \"Unemployment Percentage of Graduates Over the Years\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Percentage (%)\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2009, 2022, 2)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, you can convert the plot to an interactive plot using the ggplotly() function. This interactive plot provides additional features such as zooming, panning, auto-scaling, etc.\n\nggplotly(p)",

However, the last 2 columns contain all NA values, so we may want to remove them from analysis.\nYou’ll notice that this format isn’t ideal for data visualization. Columns 5 to 67 represent years, with their values corresponding to life expectancy for each year. However, a cleaner format would be a long data structure, where each row represents a country, a year, and the corresponding life expectancy.\nTo achieve this, we need to convert the wide format into a long format using the pivot_longer() function.",

    "text": "5.3 Long vs Wide Data\nIn R, we generally prefer working with the long data (tidy) format for data analysis, as it aligns with the principles of tidy data. A typical tidy dataset follows these rules:\n\nEach variable has its own column.\nEach observation has its own row.\nEach value has its own cell.\n\nIn contrast, wide data format has multiple columns for the same variable, which can make it harder to work with for data analysis and visualization. For example, in this life expectancy dataset, each year is represented as a separate column, however, ideally we want all years to be in a single column named “year”, and all values to be in a single column named “life_expectancy”.",
