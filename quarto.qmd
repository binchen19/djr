## Updating Quarto Website

## Updating Content

-  To update your website, make changes to your `.qmd` files and re-publish using `quarto publish`.
-  `Publish updates to:` Confirm site link and press Enter.
-  Your website will be automatically updated with the new content.

### Updating Structure

Let's say if you want your website have 4 pages:

-  Home page to show the content of `index.qmd`
-  About page to show the content of `about.qmd`
-  `Data Cleaning` to show the content of `data-cleaning.qmd`
-  `Data Analysis` to show the content of `data-analysis.qmd`

First, in addition to the existing `index.qmd` and `about.qmd`, you need to create two new `.qmd` files: 

-  `data-cleaning.qmd`
-  `data-analysis.qmd`.

Then, you need to modify the `_quarto.yml` file to add the new pages to the navigation bar.

-  Open `_quarto.yml` in RStudio.

-  Revise your `nav_bar` section to include the new pages:
```yaml
nav_bar:
  - text: Home
    href: index.html
  - text: About
    href: about.html
  - text: Data Cleaning
    href: data-cleaning.html
  - text: Data Analysis
    href: data-analysis.html
```
-  Save the `_quarto.yml` file.
-  Click the **Render** button in RStudio to preview your updated website.
-  Publish your updated website using `quarto publish`.
