## About this book

This book is a collection of my notes from the Data Journalism courses I have been teaching at The University of Hong Kong. The course is centered around using R for data analysis, equipping students with the skills to collect, clean, analyze, and visualize data in a journalistic context.

While originally designed as a companion for my students, I hope this book will also benefit a wider audienceâ€”including journalists, aspiring data storytellers, and students interested in learning R for data analysis. Through practical examples and real-world case studies, this book provides a hands-on approach to integrating data into storytelling.

Hope you find it useful! ðŸ¤—
